SNHU CS300 Course Reflection
Problem Solved: In the CS300 projects, the main problem was to design and implement various data structures and 
algorithms. This included tasks like managing and manipulating data efficiently, which is crucial for developing 
functional and optimized software.

Understanding Data Structures: 
Data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues were fundamental. They allow efficient storage, 
retrieval, and manipulation of data, which is essential for solving complex problems.
Design and Implementation: 
I carefully chose and implemented data structures based on the requirements of each project. For example, I 
used linked lists for dynamic data storage and hash tables for quick data retrieval.

Challenges: 
I faced issues with implementing certain data structures and optimizing algorithms.
Solutions:
To overcome these, I sought additional resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and forums. Breaking down 
problems into smaller steps and testing each component individually also helped.

Design Practices: 
Working on these projects highlighted the importance of choosing the right data structure for each problem. 
It expanded my approach by emphasizing efficiency and scalability in software design.

Maintainability: 
The projects taught me to write code that is not only functional but also clean and well-documented.

Readability: 
I improved my coding style by using consistent naming conventions and adding comments.

Adaptability: 
I learned to design code with future changes in mind, making it easier to adapt and extend as needed.
